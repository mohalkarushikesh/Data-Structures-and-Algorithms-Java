/*
Merge Sort
Concept: Divide and conquer by splitting the list into halves.
Steps:
Divide the list into two halves.
Recursively sort each half.
Merge the two sorted halves back together.
Visualization: Think of splitting a deck of cards into smaller piles, sorting each pile, and then merging them back together.
